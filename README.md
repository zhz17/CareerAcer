## 🚀 Project Overview

**AI Interview Analyzer** is an intelligent agent designed to analyze career pages and job postings from any company website. By processing job titles and descriptions, the agent predicts the typical interview process and generates a list of potential interview questions you might encounter for that role.

## ✨ Features

- **Webpage Analysis:** Input a URL to a career or job posting page; the agent extracts and understands the job title and description.
- **Interview Process Prediction:** Based on the company and role, the agent predicts the likely interview stages (e.g., phone screen, technical, behavioral).
- **Potential Questions Generation:** Produces a list of tailored interview questions you may be asked, including technical, behavioral, and company-specific topics.
- **Customizable:** Works for a wide range of companies and job types.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input:** Provide a link to a job posting or career page.
2. **Extraction:** The agent scrapes and parses the job title and description.
3. **Analysis:** Using AI, it infers the company's typical interview process and likely questions.
4. **Output:** You receive a structured summary of the interview process and a list of potential questions.

## 📦 Example Usage

```python
# Example (pseudo-code)
agent = InterviewAnalyzer()
result = agent.analyze("https://company.com/careers/software-engineer")
print(result.interview_process)
print(result.potential_questions)
```

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Job Seekers:** Prepare for interviews with company-specific insights.
